                    Majority of farmers in the country practise subsistence farming.
It is characterised by small and scattered land holdings and use of primitive tools.
As the farmers are poor, they do not use fertilisers and high yielding variety of seeds in their fields to the extent they should do.
Facilities like electricity and irrigation are generally not available to them.

                    In this type of agriculture, first of all a piece of forest land is cleared by felling trees and burning of trunks and branches.
After the land is cleared, crops are grown for two to three years and then the land is abandoned as the fertility of the soil decreases.
The farmers then move to new areas and the process is repeated.
Dry paddy, maize, millets and vegetables are the crops commonly grown in this type of farming.
This practice is known by different name in different regions of India like:

Jhum in Assam,
Ponam in Kerala,
Podu in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and
Bewar masha penda and Bera in various parts of Madhya Pradesh.

                    <p className="lead">
                    Plantation farming is bush or tree farming. It was introduced by the British in the 19th century.
It is a single crop farming of rubber, tea, coffee, cocoa, spices, coconut and fruit crops like apples, grapes, oranges, etc.
It is capital intensive and demands good managerial ability, technical know-how, sophisticated machinery, fertilisers, irrigation, and transport facilities.
Plantation agriculture is an export-oriented agriculture. Most of the crops grown in plantation agriculture have a life cycle of more than two years.
Natural rubber, coconuts, oil palm, tea, cocoa, and coffee are all tree crops and take years to mature, but afterwards they are productive for long periods.
Plantation agriculture is confined within tropical areas, i.e., both sides of the equator. Plantations exist on every continent possessing a tropical climate.

                    In areas where irrigation has been possible, the farmers use fertilisers and pesticides on large scale. They have also brought their land under high yielding variety of seeds. They have mechanised agriculture by introducing machines in various processes of farming.

Also known as industrial agriculture, it is characterized by a low fallow ratio and higher use of inputs such as capital and labour per unit land area. This is in contrast to traditional agriculture in which the inputs per unit land are lower.

Dryland agriculture is subject to high variability in areas sown, yields and output. These variations are the results of aberrations in weather conditions, especially rainfall. Alternate crop strategies have been worked out for important regions of the country:

Pulses or any leguminous crop is grown after the cereal crops.
Legumes have the ability of fixing nitrogen to the soil.
Highly fertilizer intensive crops like sugarcane or tobacco are rotated with cereal crops.
The selection of crops for rotation depends upon the local soil conditions and the experience and the understanding of the farmers.
